Tomas Jacob Hilfiger started his career of designing by buying jeans, customizing and selling them in his shop. He had a dream: to launch his own brand, to the point where he even refused job offers from Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis. In 1984, his eponymous brand was finally launched and has since known a thriving success (shirts, polos, shoes...). In 2006 he joined the fight against cancer by creating a unique collection.

Ursul is a French company which produces jewelry, originally only for men, but which were later adopted by women. The brand was created in 2006 by Alexis Théry. Alexis' first team was composed of a Parisian leather craftsman, a jewelry designer (Ximena Alarcon Cavrois) and an architect (Felix Millory). Together, they created the first collection, which was awarded and made to public awareness in February 2006 in Bijorhca (International Exhibition of Jewelry), as "fashion star" with the Black Silver line for men

It was in 1966 that the Van Doren Rubber Company opened its doors in Anaheim in California. In the middle of the 1970s the first skater shoe was created. Vans Sidestrip called Old Skool and Sk8-Hi were created and still represent today the style of the skater and surf scene of Southern California. A decidedly relaxed look, Vans shoes represent an ideal compromise between style and comfort.

A historical brand from America, Woolrich was created in 1830 when John Rich, an English immigrant, built his first woolen-mill in Pennsylvania. He started by providing the workers installing railways and trains to all over America. Since then, the brand has developed considerably. Woolrich crossed these decades, adapted to the changes of lifestyle in the U.S., and to the new needs.
